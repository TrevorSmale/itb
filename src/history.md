Blender 3D was initially a commercial software developed by Ton Roosendaal's company, Not a Number Technologies (NaN), in the late 1990s. However, when NaN went bankrupt in 2002, Roosendaal made Blender open-source. He founded the Blender Foundation to oversee the project and used crowdfunding and sponsorships for its support. Blender's transition to open-source led to its widespread use in 3D modeling, animation, and visual effects, with a global community of users and contributors.

* **Port to Linux** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux")

Blender was ported to Linux in the early 2000s as part of the open-source development process, which involved adapting its code to Linux's libraries and system calls. Blender was tested on various distributions and hardware configurations to address any issues, and it is now available on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The Linux version of Blender is popular among artists, designers, and developers who prefer open-source software and value the flexibility of Linux.
