### Applying subdivision surface modifier

* Select the object to which you want to apply the Subdivision Surface modifier.
* Make sure you are in Object Mode. You can switch to Object Mode by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard and selecting "Object Mode" from the mode selector in the bottom-left corner of the Blender interface.
* Press Ctrl+3 on your keyboard. This shortcut applies the Subdivision Surface modifier and sets the viewport subdivision level to 3. The object will now appear smoother and more subdivided.

Note: The Ctrl+3 shortcut is a quick way to set the subdivision level to 3, but you can also manually adjust the subdivision level in the modifier settings if desired.
