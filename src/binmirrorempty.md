### Adding Empty using for mirroring

* Make sure you are in Object Mode by selecting it from the mode selector dropdown at the top of the Blender interface.
* `Left-click` in the `3D viewport` to ensure no object is selected. This step ensures that the new empty axis will be added as a separate object.
* Press the `Shift + A` keys on your keyboard. This brings up the Add menu.
* From the Add menu, select `Empty Plain Axis` under the `empty` section. You can use the mouse to navigate the menu or press the letter `E` on your keyboard to quickly jump to the `Empty` option.
* Once you select **Empty**, a new empty axis object will be added to the scene at the location of the 3D cursor, which is represented as a small gray crosshair.
* Like any object we could move our empty axis to a specific location using the `g` key or the `transform` section of the `item tab`.
* In the case, we will leave the `Empty` where it had spawned at `(0, 0, 0)`.
