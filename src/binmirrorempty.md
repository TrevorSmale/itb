### Adding Empty using for mirroring

* Make sure you are in Object Mode by selecting it from the mode selector dropdown at the top of the Blender interface.
* Right-click in the 3D viewport to ensure no object is selected. This step ensures that the new empty axis will be added as a separate object.
* Press the Shift + A keys on your keyboard. This brings up the Add menu.
* From the Add menu, select "Empty" under the "Mesh" section. You can use the mouse to navigate the menu or press the letter E on your keyboard to quickly jump to the "Empty" option.
* Once you select "Empty," a new empty axis object will be added to the scene at the location of the 3D cursor, which is represented as a small gray crosshair.
* To move the empty axis to a specific location, you can use the transformation tools. For example, you can press the G key to activate the "Grab" tool, then use the mouse to move the empty axis to the desired position.
* Additionally, you can modify the properties of the empty axis by selecting it in the 3D viewport and accessing its properties in the Object Properties panel.
