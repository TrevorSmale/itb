## 3D Graphics concepts

* **Graphical Advantage** 

Polygon modeling offers several efficiencies over other forms of 3D graphics, such as NURBS and sculpting. Here are some advantages of polygon modeling:

1. Flexibility: Polygon modeling allows for great flexibility in terms of creating different shapes and structures. It is easier to create complex geometric shapes with polygon modeling than with other techniques, and it is also easier to make changes to the model if needed.

2. Real-time rendering: Polygon models are usually lightweight and easy to render in real-time, making them ideal for use in video games, virtual reality, and other real-time applications.

3. Texturing: Polygon models are easy to texture and UV map, making them ideal for creating detailed and realistic models for film and gaming.

4. Animation: Polygon models are easy to animate, and can be rigged and posed in a variety of ways, making them ideal for creating animated characters and objects.

5. Efficiency: Polygon modeling is a relatively fast and efficient way of creating 3D models, making it a popular choice for many industries. It requires less processing power than other techniques, making it more accessible to a wider range of users.

* **Polygon Mesh** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh)

Polygon modeling is a 3D computer graphics technique that uses interconnected flat polygons to define the shape of complex models. It offers flexibility and control, allowing for highly detailed and realistic designs with low processing requirements. 

* **Normals** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry))

Polygon normals are vectors that determine the orientation of a polygon in 3D space. They point outward from the polygon's surface and are calculated by taking the cross product of two edges. In computer graphics, polygon normals influence how light interacts with a model, affecting its shading, reflections, and specular highlights. They also determine the direction of surface-based effects.

* **Shaders** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader)

Shaders are programs used in 3D computer graphics to control the appearance of surfaces and objects. They are written in a special programming language that allows them to manipulate the color, texture, and lighting of 3D models. Shaders are used to create a variety of visual effects, such as realistic lighting and shadows, reflections, and transparency. They can also be used to create special effects such as distortion, motion blur, and heat shimmer. 

* **Texture Mapping** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping)

Texture mapping is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to apply a 2D image or texture onto a 3D model's surface. It involves mapping each point on the surface of the model to a corresponding point on the 2D texture, using UV coordinates. Texture mapping is used to add detail and realism to 3D models, by applying textures such as wood, metal, or fabric. The texture can be manipulated and adjusted to fit the model's surface precisely. 

* **UV Mapping** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping)

UV texture coordinates are a 2D coordinate system used to map a 2D image or texture onto a 3D model in 3D computer graphics. The letters "U" and "V" refer to the two dimensions of the coordinate system, which are perpendicular to each other and represent the horizontal and vertical axes of the texture image. The UV coordinates are assigned to each vertex of the 3D model, which allows the texture to be mapped onto the surface of the model in a precise and accurate way.

* **Types of Maps** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_mapping)

There are several types of texture maps used in 3D computer graphics. Here are some of the most common types:

1. Diffuse map: This is the most basic type of texture map, and it defines the color and appearance of the surface of the 3D model.

2. Normal map: This type of texture map is used to add detail and depth to a 3D model's surface by simulating the appearance of bumps and creases.

3. Specular map: This type of texture map defines the reflective properties of a surface, determining how light interacts with the surface and creating the appearance of shiny or glossy materials.

4. Ambient occlusion map: This type of texture map is used to add depth and realism to a 3D model by simulating the way light is absorbed and scattered by surfaces in the environment.

5. Displacement map: This type of texture map is used to add highly detailed geometry to a 3D model's surface by creating the appearance of height and depth.

6. Emissive map: This type of texture map is used to add the appearance of self-illumination or glowing parts to a 3D model.

These are just a few examples of the types of texture maps used in 3D computer graphics. Different types of texture maps can be combined and used together to create highly detailed and realistic 3D models.

* **RayTracing** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light as it interacts with objects in a scene. It works by tracing the path of light rays as they travel from a virtual camera through the scene and interact with objects, determining how the light is reflected and refracted by each object.
