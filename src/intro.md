# Introduction to Blender 
## Instructor-Led

We will follow a lecture format with live demonstrations. I strongly encourage you to participate actively by replicating each demo as it is presented. This hands-on approach, akin to experiential learning, enriches your learning experience and empowers you with practical skills through direct engagement.

Because we need to cover a substantial array of concepts within our three-hour timeframe, reviewing the notes thoroughly before the next hands-on session is highly advisable. This review will strengthen your grasp of the material and better prepare you for active participation in the upcoming session.

Feel free to ask questions at the end of each section. If you need clarification or further information on any topic discussed, donâ€™t hesitate to speak up.
