Workspaces are used to organize the various tools and features of Blender in a way that is most efficient and productive for the user. Each workspace can be customized to include different windows and panels, and can be saved and loaded for future use.

* **Top Bar** [LINK to image](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.4/_images/interface_window-system_introduction_default-screen.png "Blender Manual")

The top bar in the Blender workspace is a horizontal bar located at the top of the interface, above the 3D viewport. It contains several menus and options that provide access to various features and settings in Blender. The top bar includes menus for file management, editing modes, object selection, view options, and rendering settings. It also includes buttons for adding objects, toggling between different modes, and accessing the preferences and add-ons. The top bar is a central location for many of Blender's most commonly used features and can be customized to include additional options or add-ons.

* **Status bar** [LINK to Page](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.4/interface/window_system/status_bar.html "Blender Manual")

The status bar in Blender is a narrow horizontal panel located at the bottom of the interface, below the 3D viewport. It provides information about the current state of the program and the active tool or feature. The status bar displays important information such as the current mode, selected object or component, the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the active mesh, and the current frame number for animation playback. It also displays status messages and warnings, and provides access to various system settings and preferences. The status bar is a helpful tool for monitoring the progress of operations and keeping track of important information while working in Blender.

(Hide & Reveal with 'T')

Located on the left-hand side of the Blender interface, the Blender Toolbar is a comprehensive collection of tools and functionalities. It offers quick access to a wide range of options for modeling, sculpting, texturing, animating, rendering, and more. 

* **Outliner** [LINK to Page](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.4/editors/outliner/introduction.html "Blender Manual")

The Blender Outliner is a hierarchical list view that provides a visual representation and organizational structure of the objects, collections, and data within a Blender scene.

* **Panels** [LINK to Page](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.4/interface/window_system/tabs_panels.html "Blender Manual")

Tabs in the Blender UI refer to the horizontal tabs at the top of the interface that allow users to switch between different editor types and workspaces, providing a flexible and customizable layout.

Panels in the Blender UI are vertical sections within editors that contain various settings, options, and tools related to specific functions, allowing users to access and modify specific aspects of their projects efficiently.

* **Modes** Demonstration

Blender modes are different editing contexts within the software that enable users to perform specific actions and manipulate objects, such as object mode for overall scene editing, edit mode for vertex-level modifications, and sculpt mode for more organic and detailed sculpting.
