## Adding & Removing Objects

In Blender, adding items is done by utilizing specific shortcuts to quickly create objects or elements within the scene, such as Shift + A to bring up the Add menu and choose from a variety of primitives or Shift + A, followed by M, to add a new material.

On the other hand, deleting items is typically done by selecting the desired object or element and pressing the Delete key or X key, which brings up a menu with options to delete the selected item, vertices, edges, or faces, depending on the active mode (Edit mode, Vertex mode, etc.). Additionally, using the shortcut Shift + X allows for deleting only the selected vertices, edges, or faces without deleting the entire object.
