#### By Using Grab (G)

* Select the object you want to move by clicking on it in the 3D viewport. You can also select multiple objects by holding down the Shift key and clicking on each object.
* Press the G key on your keyboard to activate the "Grab" or move tool. This allows you to move the selected object(s).
* Press the X key on your keyboard to constrain the movement to the X-axis.
* Now, you can use the mouse to move the object back and forth along the X-axis. Simply move the mouse in the desired direction.
* Alternatively, if you want to move the object on the Z-axis by a specific distance, you can type a numerical value on your keyboard. For example, if you want to move the object 2 units up on the X-axis, type "2" and then press Enter.
* Once you have positioned the object at the desired location on the Z-axis, left-click the mouse or press Enter to confirm the movement.
