## Free & Open Source Software (F.O.S.S) 

* **Transparency** [LINK to Git Repository](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender "Blender Repo")

Transparency in open source software refers to the practice of freely sharing the source code, enabling users to access, review, and modify it. It promotes collaboration and innovation, as developers can contribute to existing projects and improve them. The transparency fosters a community-driven approach, allowing for continuous improvement and evolution.

A controllable Rover web-app, Experience Curiosity, to simulated space exploration of Exoplanets, to mobile-based Augmented Reality.

Brian Kumanchik, Project Lead & Art Director of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory implemented Blender into the workflow of JPL because it has a mature WebGL engine for interactive 3D browswer experiences.

Background The VI-Suite is a free and open-source addon for the 3D content creation application Blender, developed primarily as a tool for the contextual and performative analysis of buildings. Its functionality has grown from simple, static lighting analysis to fully parametric lighting, shadowing, and building energy analyses.

* **The licensing allows for**

1. The freedom to use the software for any purpose
2. The freedom to access and examine the source code
3. The freedom to modify the software and distribute modifications
4. The freedom to distribute copies of the software to others

Together, these four freedoms give users and developers the ability to understand, modify, and distribute open source software without any limitations, promoting transparency, collaboration, and innovation in the software industry.
