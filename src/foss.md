## Free & Open Source Software (F.O.S.S) 

### Transparency  
[Git Repository](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender "Blender Repo")  

Transparency in open-source software refers to the practice of freely sharing the **source code**, enabling users to access, review, and modify it. This fosters **collaboration** and **innovation**, allowing developers to contribute to existing projects and improve them. Transparency promotes a **community-driven** approach, ensuring continuous development and evolution.

### Unexpected Outcomes  

#### Experience Curiosity – Mars Rover Web App  
[NASA Curiosity Rover Project](https://www.blender.org/user-stories/nasas-experience-curiosity/ "NASA Curiosity Rover")  

NASA's **Experience Curiosity** is an interactive **Rover web app** designed for simulating space exploration of exoplanets and mobile-based **Augmented Reality (AR)**.  

**Brian Kumanchik**, Project Lead & Art Director at **NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**, integrated **Blender** into JPL's workflow due to its **mature WebGL engine**, which enables **interactive 3D browser experiences**.

#### Environmental Analysis Tool  
[VI-Suite Research](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Blender-interface-with-VI-Suite-elements_fig6_319700974 "Environmental Analysis Tool")  

The **VI-Suite** is a free and open-source **Blender add-on** developed for **contextual and performance-based building analysis**. Originally designed for **static lighting analysis**, its capabilities have expanded to include:  
- **Parametric lighting simulations**  
- **Shadowing analysis**  
- **Building energy assessments**  

This tool helps architects and engineers evaluate environmental conditions and optimize energy efficiency.

#### Open Street Map 3D for Urban Planning  
[OSM Blender Addon](https://github.com/vvoovv/blender-osm "Blender OSM")  

The **Blender-OSM** add-on allows users to import **real-world geographic data** from **OpenStreetMap** into Blender for **urban planning, game design, and architectural visualization**.  
- Users can generate **3D cities** with roads, buildings, and terrain.  
- The **procedural reconfiguration** feature allows developers to modify imported city models for simulation, rendering, or virtual reality projects.  
- Because the project is **open-source**, developers have contributed to its expansion by adding **real-time rendering improvements** and integration with **GIS systems**.

#### Medical Visualization & 3D Surgical Simulation  
[3D Slicer + Blender](https://www.slicer.org/ "3D Slicer")  

The **3D Slicer + Blender integration** is an open-source initiative that enables **medical researchers and surgeons** to visualize **MRI and CT scan data in 3D** using Blender's rendering capabilities.  
- Open-source **Python scripts** allow seamless transfer between **3D Slicer** and **Blender** for surgical planning.  
- Custom plugins were developed by the **biomedical research community** to refine anatomical structures for **virtual surgical simulations**.  
- This project exemplifies how Blender's **open architecture** enables contributions from **non-traditional industries**, fostering innovation in medical imaging.
