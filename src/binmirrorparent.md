### Parenting an object to the Empty

* Select the object(s) that you want to parent to the empty axis. You can select multiple objects by holding down the Shift key while clicking on each object.
* Shift-select the empty axis object to make it the active object. The active object is the last object selected and will be the parent of the other selected objects.
* Press Ctrl + P on your keyboard to bring up the Parent menu.
* From the Parent menu, select "Object" to parent the selected objects to the empty axis.
* The selected objects will now be parented to the empty axis. You can verify this by moving or rotating the empty axis, and the child objects will follow along.
