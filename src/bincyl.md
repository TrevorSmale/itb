### Creation of a cylinder primitive

* Press `Shift + A` to open the Add menu. 
* Blender has a Fuzzy Finding Feature, typing `cyl` will present the option of Cylinder.
* The Cylinder will be facing up when inserted.
* Rotate it 90 Deg on the Y Axis using a string of commands `r, y, 90`. This can also be achieved through the `item` tab.
* By default, the 3D cursor will be located at (0, 0, 0), so a new Cylinder would be place at that location with a Diameter of 2 Units and a length of 2 units.
* We are going to lengthen the cylinders using scale with another string of commands `s, x, 2`, scaling the cylinders length axially by 2. Alternatively, the length can be altered using the dimension section of the `item` tab.
