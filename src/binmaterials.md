### Creating & Naming Materials

* Select the object or objects to which you want to assign a material by clicking on them in the 3D viewport.
* Go to the "Material" tab in the Properties panel (located in the sidebar on the right-hand side of the Blender interface, usually accessed by pressing the N key).
* If no material slots are available, click the "+" button next to the material list to add a new material slot for the selected object(s).
* With the material slot selected, click the "New" button to create a new material. By default, it will be named "Material".
* To rename the material, click on the material's name field (e.g., "Material") and enter a new name for the material. Press Enter to confirm the new name.
* Adjust the material's properties, such as its color, roughness, metallicness, or any other desired attributes, using the various options available in the material settings.
* If you want to assign the material to other objects, select the objects and click the material dropdown menu in the material slot. Choose the desired material name from the list.

Repeat the process to create and name additional materials as needed.

Naming materials is helpful for better organization and easy identification of materials when working on complex scenes with multiple objects. It allows you to assign different appearances, properties, and textures to specific materials, enhancing the overall visual quality of your work in Blender.
