### Lighting setup

* Open Blender and ensure you have a scene set up with objects.

* In the 3D viewport, make sure you are in "Object Mode" by pressing the Tab key if necessary.

* By default, Blender starts with a basic light source called "Lamp". You can adjust this light or add additional lights for more control and realism.

* To add a new light, go to the "Add" menu at the top of the 3D viewport or use the Shift + A shortcut. Choose "Light" and select the type of light you want to add (e.g., "Point", "Sun", "Area", "Spot", etc.). The new light will be placed at the origin (0, 0, 0) in the scene.

* Position the light source by selecting it and using the Move (shortcut: G) and Rotate (shortcut: R) tools to place it where you want. You can also adjust the light's properties in the "Light" tab of the Properties panel (located in the sidebar on the right-hand side of the Blender interface, usually accessed by pressing the N key).

* Experiment with different types of lights and their properties to achieve the desired lighting setup. For example, a "Point" light emits light in all directions, while a "Sun" light mimics the sun's directional light.

You can also adjust the strength (intensity) of the light source in the "Light" tab or directly in the 3D viewport by selecting the light and adjusting the Strength value.
