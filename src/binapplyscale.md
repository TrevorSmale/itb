### Applying the objects scale

* Select the object you want to apply the scale to. You can select an object by right-clicking on it in the 3D Viewport.
* Make sure you are in Object Mode. You can switch to Object Mode by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard and selecting "Object Mode" from the mode selector in the bottom-left corner of the Blender interface.
* Go to the "Object" menu at the top of the Blender interface.
* From the "Object" menu, choose "Apply" and then select "Scale" from the submenu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Ctrl+A and then choose "Scale" from the options.
* After applying the scale, the object's scale will be set to 1, effectively resetting any scaling transformations that were previously applied to the object. The object's size will appear normalized based on its new scale.
