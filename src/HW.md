# Hardware Requirements

## Blender Foundation recommendations

Blender does have some special hardware requirements that may not be satisfied by the average computer.
Blender.org lists the minimum hardware requirements as follows:

* 64-bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support.
* 8 GB RAM.
* Full HD display.
* Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet.
* Graphics card with 2 GB RAM, OpenGL 4.3.
* Less than 10 year old.

Please note that these are the minimum system requirements. If you are planning on using this software to create more advanced projects, it is best to look at what Blender artists recommend.

# Additional Notes:

## Graphics

It is best to have a [Dedicated Graphics Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card "Wiki Page") for using 3D software like Blender. 3D modeling and rendering typically utilizes large amounts of virtual memory. Dedicated graphics cards have additional virtual memory for this purpose. Some integrated graphics systems in laptops and mini computers work for light projects as well. It is best to do a bit of personal research into the matter. 

Most cards over the past decade will be just fine so long as you're packing at least 2GB of video memory on the Nvidia GeForce 400 series, AMD's Radeon HD 7000 range, or newer. CPU-wise, you're looking at a quad-core processor to get the program running.

If this information is making your head spin, then the demo scene stress test should at least confirm that your computer will work for this course.

## Mouse

I urge you to use a dedicated mouse with a mechanical clickable centrewheel. The clickable centrewheel will be used often for panning and rotation of the 3D scene. Most mid-grade dedicated mice include this feature. 

Until you are familiar with the interface, please do note use:

* A trackpad
* A touch-based mouse eg. Apple Magic Mouse
* A digitizer tablet eg. Wacom

If you in need of a different mouse, here are a few low cost recommendations that are easy to find online or pick up at staples. Note: both of these mice do not have bluetooth and require a USB A port for the wireless receiver.

## Display

Blender has a rather large and complex user interface with many small buttons and windows. It is best to use a large, high resolution monitor in order to maximize the UI spread. Otherwise, buttons may be hidden or minimized, causing some confusion for the uninitiated.
