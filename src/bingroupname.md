### Scene setup & Management (Grouping & Naming)

#### Grouping Objects:

4. Select the objects you want to group together. You can select multiple objects by holding down the Shift key while clicking on each object.

* Press Ctrl + G to create a new group. A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to name the group. Enter a descriptive name for the group and press Enter to confirm.

* The selected objects are now grouped together under the specified name.

#### Naming Objects:

* Select an object by clicking on it in the 3D viewport.

* In the "Object" tab of the Properties panel (located in the sidebar on the right-hand side of the Blender interface, usually accessed by pressing the N key), locate the "Object" section.

* Find the "Name" field under the "Object" section and enter a meaningful name for the object.

* Press Enter to confirm the new name.

* Repeat this process for each object in your scene, giving them descriptive names to help organize and identify them easily.
