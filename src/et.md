## Editor Types

### Edit Mode

The 1, 2, and 3 keyboard commands in Blender are used to quickly access different selection modes within Edit mode in the 3D Viewport editor. These shortcuts allow users to switch between selecting vertices, edges, and faces with ease.

**1: Vertex Selection Mode**

Pressing the `1` key enters Vertex selection mode in Edit mode. This allows users to select individual vertices of a mesh for editing or manipulation.

**2: Edge Selection Mode**

Pressing the `2` key activates Edge selection mode. In this mode, users can select edges of the mesh, which can be useful for tasks such as edge extrusion or creating sharp edges.

**3: Face Selection Mode**

Pressing the `3` key switches to Face selection mode. This mode enables users to select entire faces of the mesh, which is particularly handy for tasks like extruding or modifying large surface areas.

Edit mode in Blender is a specific mode within the 3D Viewport editor that allows users to modify the geometry of selected objects at the vertex, edge, or face level. It provides a range of tools and shortcuts for precise editing and manipulation of the mesh.

Here are some associated shortcuts commonly used in Edit mode:

**Selection:**
- Right-click: Selects a vertex, edge, or face under the cursor.
- `B`: Activates box selection, allowing users to drag a selection box to select multiple vertices, edges, or faces.
- `C`: Enables circle selection, where users can select vertices, edges, or faces within a circular area.
- `Ctrl + Left-click`: Adds or removes vertices, edges, or faces from the selection.
- `Ctrl + L`: Selects all connected vertices, edges, or faces to the currently selected element.

**Transformation:**
- `G`: Translates (moves) selected vertices, edges, or faces.
- `R`: Rotates selected vertices, edges, or faces.
- `S`: Scales selected vertices, edges, or faces.
- `Alt + G`: Resets the translation (moves) of selected vertices, edges, or faces.
- `Alt + R`: Resets the rotation of selected vertices, edges, or faces.
- `Alt + S`: Resets the scale of selected vertices, edges, or faces.

**Mesh Editing:**
- `E`: Extrudes selected vertices, edges, or faces to create new geometry.
- `F`: Creates an edge or face between selected vertices or edges.
- `Ctrl + R`: Activates the Loop Cut tool, allowing users to create new edge loops.
- `Ctrl + B`: Enables the Bevel tool, which creates beveled edges or faces.

**Vertex/Edge/Face Operations:**
- `Ctrl + V`: Opens the Vertex context menu with various vertex-related operations.
- `Ctrl + E`: Opens the Edge context menu with various edge-related operations.
- `Ctrl + F`: Opens the Face context menu with various face-related operations.
