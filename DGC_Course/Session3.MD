# Session #3

## Course Intro

In this second half of Intro to Blender, we will follow a lecture format with demonstrations. I strongly encourage you to actively participate by trying to mimic the demos as they are presented. This hands-on approach will enhance your learning experience and allow you to gain practical skills by actively engaging with the material. 

Given the extensive amount of concepts to cover during these three hours, it is highly recommended that you thoroughly review the notes before the next hands-on session. This review will help solidify your understanding of the material and prepare you for active participation in the upcoming session.

## Topics covered in the previous two sessions

- [Session 1](Session1.md)
- [Session 2](Session2.md)

## Modeling Workshop Session

In the second half of this introductory course, we will focus on modeling more complex shapes, utilizing modifiers to create natural distortions, and generating sophisticated generative textures. The culmination of these topics will be an aesthetically pleasing rendering of a wine bottle.
