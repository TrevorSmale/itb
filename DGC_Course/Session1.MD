## History of Blender

* **Ton Roosendaal** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton_Roosendaal "Wikipedia")

Ton Roosendaal is a Dutch software developer and entrepreneur best known for founding the Blender Foundation and overseeing the development of Blender, a popular open-source 3D graphics software. He was born on March 20, 1960, in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and began his career as a digital artist and programmer in the 1980s. In 1998, he founded Not a Number Technologies (NaN), a company that developed and distributed Blender. After NaN went bankrupt in 2002, Roosendaal founded the Blender Foundation and made Blender open-source. Today, Blender is widely used in industries such as film, animation, and gaming, and Roosendaal continues to oversee its development and support the Blender community.

* **Brief History** [LINK to Blender.org/History](https://www.blender.org/about/history/ "History")

Blender 3D was originally developed as a commercial software by Ton Roosendaal's company, Not a Number Technologies (NaN), in the late 1990s. However, when NaN went bankrupt in 2002, Roosendaal decided to make Blender open-source, which means that the source code was made available to the public for free and anyone could contribute to its development. He founded the Blender Foundation to oversee the open-source project and used crowdfunding and sponsorships to support its development. This decision to make Blender open-source has allowed the software to grow into a widely-used tool for 3D modeling, animation, and visual effects, with a vibrant community of users and contributors around the world.

* **Port to Linux** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux")

Blender was ported to Linux in the early 2000s as part of the open-source development process, which involved adapting its code to Linux's libraries and system calls. Blender was tested on various distributions and hardware configurations to address any issues, and it is now available on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The Linux version of Blender is popular among artists, designers, and developers who prefer open-source software and value the flexibility of Linux.

## Free & Open Source Software (F.O.S.S) 

* **Transparency** [LINK to Git Repository](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender "Blender Repo")

Transparency in the context of open source software refers to the practice of making the source code of a software project freely available to its users and allowing them to access, review, and modify it. This means that anyone can examine the source code, understand how the software works, and make changes to it if necessary. The transparency of open source software allows for collaboration and innovation, as developers can build on top of existing projects, contributing to their improvement and evolution. It also promotes accountability and trust between developers and users, as anyone can scrutinize the code for security vulnerabilities, errors, or malicious behavior. Overall, transparency is a key principle of the open source philosophy and has played a significant role in the success and growth of the open source movement.

* **Collaboration** [Link to example project](https://www.blender.org/user-stories/nasas-experience-curiosity/ "NASA Curiosity Rover")

Collaboration is an essential aspect of open source software development, where developers from different backgrounds and locations work together to improve and maintain software projects. The transparency of the source code in open source projects facilitates collaboration, as anyone can contribute to the project by reviewing and improving the code, reporting bugs, or adding new features. Collaboration in open source software development often occurs through online forums, mailing lists, and code repositories where developers can share ideas, discuss issues, and contribute code changes. By collaborating, developers can leverage each other's skills and knowledge, leading to faster innovation and higher quality software. Additionally, collaboration in open source projects fosters a sense of community, where individuals are united by their passion for creating open and accessible software for everyone.

* **Freedom** [LINK to Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Blender-interface-with-VI-Suite-elements_fig6_319700974 "Envrionemental Analysis Modification")

The statements about transparency and collaboration in open source software imply four fundamental freedoms, commonly known as the "four essential freedoms" of open source software. These freedoms include:

1. The freedom to use the software for any purpose
2. The freedom to access and examine the source code
3. The freedom to modify the software and distribute modifications
4. The freedom to distribute copies of the software to others

Together, these four freedoms give users and developers the ability to understand, modify, and distribute open source software without any limitations, promoting transparency, collaboration, and innovation in the software industry.

## 3D Graphics

* **Graphical Advantage** 

Polygon modeling offers several efficiencies over other forms of 3D graphics, such as NURBS and sculpting. Here are some advantages of polygon modeling:

1. Flexibility: Polygon modeling allows for great flexibility in terms of creating different shapes and structures. It is easier to create complex geometric shapes with polygon modeling than with other techniques, and it is also easier to make changes to the model if needed.

2. Real-time rendering: Polygon models are usually lightweight and easy to render in real-time, making them ideal for use in video games, virtual reality, and other real-time applications.

3. Texturing: Polygon models are easy to texture and UV map, making them ideal for creating detailed and realistic models for film and gaming.

4. Animation: Polygon models are easy to animate, and can be rigged and posed in a variety of ways, making them ideal for creating animated characters and objects.

5. Efficiency: Polygon modeling is a relatively fast and efficient way of creating 3D models, making it a popular choice for many industries. It requires less processing power than other techniques, making it more accessible to a wider range of users.

* **Polygon Mesh** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh)

Polygon modeling is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to create complex 3D models by defining their shape through the use of interconnected flat polygons. These polygons are manipulated and transformed in order to create the desired shape of the model. Polygon modeling allows for great flexibility and control over the details of a model, as well as the ability to create highly detailed and realistic models with relatively low processing requirements. It is a widely used technique in industries such as video games, film, and architecture, and is often combined with other modeling techniques such as sculpting and texturing to create highly detailed and realistic models.

* **Normals** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry))

Polygon normals are vectors that define the orientation of a polygon or face in 3D space. They are calculated as the cross product of two edges of the polygon, and point outwards from the surface of the polygon. Polygon normals are used in 3D computer graphics to determine how light interacts with the surface of a model, affecting the shading and appearance of the model. They are also used to determine the direction of surface-based effects such as reflections and specular highlights.

* **Shaders** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader)

Shaders are programs used in 3D computer graphics to control the appearance of surfaces and objects. They are written in a special programming language that allows them to manipulate the color, texture, and lighting of 3D models. Shaders are used to create a variety of visual effects, such as realistic lighting and shadows, reflections, and transparency. They can also be used to create special effects such as distortion, motion blur, and heat shimmer. 

* **Texture Mapping** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping)

Texture mapping is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to apply a 2D image or texture onto a 3D model's surface. It involves mapping each point on the surface of the model to a corresponding point on the 2D texture, using UV coordinates. Texture mapping is used to add detail and realism to 3D models, by applying textures such as wood, metal, or fabric. The texture can be manipulated and adjusted to fit the model's surface precisely. 

* **UV Mapping** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping)

UV texture coordinates are a 2D coordinate system used to map a 2D image or texture onto a 3D model in 3D computer graphics. The letters "U" and "V" refer to the two dimensions of the coordinate system, which are perpendicular to each other and represent the horizontal and vertical axes of the texture image. The UV coordinates are assigned to each vertex of the 3D model, which allows the texture to be mapped onto the surface of the model in a precise and accurate way. UV texture coordinates are essential for creating realistic textures on 3D models in applications such as video games, film, and architecture.

* **Types of Maps** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_mapping)

There are several types of texture maps used in 3D computer graphics. Here are some of the most common types:

1. Diffuse map: This is the most basic type of texture map, and it defines the color and appearance of the surface of the 3D model.

2. Normal map: This type of texture map is used to add detail and depth to a 3D model's surface by simulating the appearance of bumps and creases.

3. Specular map: This type of texture map defines the reflective properties of a surface, determining how light interacts with the surface and creating the appearance of shiny or glossy materials.

4. Ambient occlusion map: This type of texture map is used to add depth and realism to a 3D model by simulating the way light is absorbed and scattered by surfaces in the environment.

5. Displacement map: This type of texture map is used to add highly detailed geometry to a 3D model's surface by creating the appearance of height and depth.

6. Emissive map: This type of texture map is used to add the appearance of self-illumination or glowing parts to a 3D model.

These are just a few examples of the types of texture maps used in 3D computer graphics. Different types of texture maps can be combined and used together to create highly detailed and realistic 3D models.

* **RayTracing** [LINK to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))

Ray tracing is a rendering technique used in 3D computer graphics to simulate the behavior of light as it interacts with objects in a scene. It works by tracing the path of light rays as they travel from a virtual camera through the scene and interact with objects, determining how the light is reflected and refracted by each object. This information is then used to generate a highly detailed and realistic image of the scene, including shadows, reflections, and other lighting effects. Ray tracing can create highly realistic images but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. It is widely used in industries such as film, architecture, and product design to create highly realistic 3D visualizations.
